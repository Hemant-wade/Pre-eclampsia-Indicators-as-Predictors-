# Pre-eclampsia-Indicators-as-Predictors-
Developed a machine learning model for early detection of Postpartum Depression (PPD) using the PRAMS dataset (2012-2020). The project leveraged pre-eclampsia as a key predictor, employing algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, and TabNet, achieving notable accuracy in early PPD identification."
